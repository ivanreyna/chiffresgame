The-game-Des-Chiffres-et-Des-Lettres
Number Game
The game randomly selects a target number between 100 and 999.
You are given six random numbers (small numbers between 1-10 and large numbers: 25, 50, 75, 100).
Your task is to use these numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get as close as possible to the target number.
You may perform operations step-by-step, and you have the option to stop or continue adding more operations.
Your score is calculated based on how close your result is to the target, with a maximum of 100 points.
The score decreases by 1 point for every 10 units you are away from the target.

After the letters are generated, you must form the longest word you can using the provided letters.
The game will find the longest valid word that can be formed using the same letters from a dictionary.
Your score is based on the length of your word compared to the longest possible word, with a maximum score of 100 points.
